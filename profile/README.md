## Project Overview

- **Project Name:** SmartSight (Luna)
- **Goal:** To eliminate the hassle of manual study logging and develop an AI coach that automatically analyzes and guides study sessions using the 1st-person perspective (POV) of Meta Ray-Ban glasses.
- **Core Value:** "Visualizing the learning journey without ever interrupting learning itself."

---

## Inspiration & Problem Statement

### **Limitations of Traditional Study Tracking**
* **Manual Logging Hassle:** Requirements for manual logging (starting timers, selecting subjects) break the flow and cause distractions.
* **Lacks Contextual Data:** Simply measuring 'study time' lacks the contextual feedback needed to understand what was actually covered.
* **Low Output vs. Input:** A lack of feedback loops means the energy spent on logging doesn't effectively lead to improved learning efficiency.

### **SmartSight’s Solution**
* **Hands-free Tracking:** Meta Ray-Ban cameras and microphones quietly observe and automatically log study sessions as they happen.
* **Contextual Insight:** AI analyzes 1st-person POV images to identify study content, engagement levels, and distractions (like phone usage).

---

## Key Features

### **1. Hands-Free Automatic Logging**
* Automatically tracks study sessions, subjects, and time spent without needing to touch a phone.
* AI automatically tags subjects (Biology, Math, etc.) and subtopics from the 1st-person POV images.

### **2. AI-Powered Contextual Analysis**
* **Learning State Analysis:** Determines if the student is actively solving problems or passively reading.
* **Study Telemetry:** Provides consistent, machine-readable metrics on learning quality using structured JSON data.
* **Distraction Monitoring:** Detects distractions, such as central phone visibility, within the user's field of view.

### **3. Real-time AI Coach**
* **Voice Support:** If you're "Stuck? Just ask" — receive instant voice-based guidance without breaking focus.
* **Coaching Principles:** Specifically designed to avoid giving direct answers, instead asking reflective questions to encourage reasoning.

### **4. Learning Dashboard**
* Visualizes metrics such as time per topic, active/passive ratios, and help counts via an iOS application.
